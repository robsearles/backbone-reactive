Backbone Reactive
====================

This is a small project I used to experiment with building a [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) application that could handle reactive design.

There is an accompanying series of [blog posts](http://www.robsearles.com/category/tutorials/backbone-reactive/) that explain my thought process behind this and the avenues I went down when exploring this subject matter.
